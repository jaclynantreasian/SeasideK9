        <p class="copy">Ethan and Molly are a married couple with three lovely dogs of their own. Ethan is an Army Veteran and takes care of the animals full time. Molly is a Visual Art Teacher for Boston Public Schools and helps with the animals during the evenings and weekends. Ethan and Molly have always been happier when surrounded by animals. Ethan grew up with dogs, cats, horses, chickens, and bunnies. Molly worked in a grooming salon throughout college and that was when she realized how much she enjoyed taking care of animals. </br>
        Ethan and Molly have done an extensive amount of dog training for all of their pups including obedience, agility, nosework, and plain old tricks. All of the skills they have learned have taught them so much about keeping dogs safe and happy, both physically and mentally. Ethan and Molly, and even their three dogs, all work together to ensure each animal gets all the love and attention they deserve!
