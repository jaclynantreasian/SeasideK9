          <p>Maya has stayed with Molly and Ethan for a weekend and for just daycare now. Each time she has come home she’s been happy and sleepy! We know whenever we need care for Maya, that Molly and Ethan are our go-to people. Thank you for opening your home to our fur baby.</p>

          <p>Sonny had another great 2-night stay with Molly & Ethan while we were away! He can be shy and timid staying in new places but loved playing outside in their backyard with their daycare dogs during the day and getting extra attention at night. You could tell he was happy and more comfortable in all the photos they sent. They're the best!</p>

          <p>Ethan & Molly were AMAZING!! Our lab Ralph stayed with them for a weekend & every picture that was sent to me, Ralph had such a big smile on his face! They were great with communication & made sure Ralph had so much fun. We will 100% be brining Ralph back for daycare & weekend stays.</p>

          <p>Molly and Ethan are fantastic! It was very easy to schedule the overnight stay for our husky mix, and their place seems perfectly suited as a dog hangout. They respond quickly to questions, and were very flexible on timing. Our pup had such a good time that he slept most of the next day, having expended all his energy at his sleepover! Great experience, highly recommended.</p>
