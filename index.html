        <h3>Let's Play All Day!</h3>
        <p>At Seaside K9s, all dogs get plenty of exercise and fresh air. We spend most of our days romping around in our yard which has hygienic animal friendly turf. We believe that a tired pup is a happy,and better behaved, pup. Therefore, we incorporate structured walks, socialization, and food puzzles into all stays.</p>

        <p>Our pup, Cupcake, loves going to Molly and Ethan’s! She always comes home happy and tired. They are great communicators and send great pics during her stays. She has done day and overnights with them and we always feel good leaving her in their caring and competent hands!<p>

        <h5>Brenna G</h5>
        <p>Sonny had another great 2-night stay with Molly & Ethan while we were away! He can be shy and timid staying in new places but loved playing outside in their backyard with their daycare dogs during the day and getting extra attention at night. You could tell he was happy and more comfortable in all the photos they sent. They're the best!<p>
