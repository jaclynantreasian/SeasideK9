       <p>&quot;As a first time puppy mom, Ethan put my mind at ease! The updates throughout the day are great and [Babka] always comes home tired. The backyard looks amazing! They are super responsive and flexible which are both big wins in my book. Love that I&apos;ve found someone locally and will continue to recommend their services to everyone I know.&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Molly &amp; Ethan were extremely helpful and accommodating, and my King Charles Spaniel puppy loved his stay with them. [Beau] is a bit shy with people, but I was confident that Molly &amp; Ethan kept him safe, and he seemed to have a great time playing with the other dogs. We received cute and hilarious pictures throughout the stay. Will book again in the future!&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;Molly and Ethan are great! They respond quickly and are very accommodating. They send pictures of DeeDee throughout the stay. A pleasure to deal with!&quot;<p>

          <p>&quot;Molly and Ethan were very welcoming and had a calm energy which I believe my pup needs! They even invited me into their space knowing I had a less than perfect previous experience with someone. Sheldon didn&apos;t want to leave and tried to follow Ethan back into their home. Definitely booking again!&quot;

          <p>&quot;Ethan &amp; Molly were AMAZING!! Our lab Ralph stayed with them for a weekend &amp; every picture that was sent to me, Ralph had such a big smile on his face! They were great with communication &amp; made sure Ralph had so much fun. We will 100% be bringing Ralph back for daycare &amp; weekend stays.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Molly and Ethan have taken amazing care of my sweet, active, deaf pittie mix, Misa several times. She is in love with them and their pups! I go away completely comfortable and confident she is cared for with genuine love. She gets lots of outdoor play time and lots of snuggles at the end of each fun-filled day. Oh, and they administer her medications twice each day, too! We are so lucky to have Molly and Ethan!&quot;</p>
